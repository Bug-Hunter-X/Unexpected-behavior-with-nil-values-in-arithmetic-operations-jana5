This repository demonstrates an uncommon Lua bug related to implicit type conversion of 'nil' values in arithmetic operations.  The bug occurs when using 'nil' with numerical types, as Lua implicitly treats 'nil' as 0 in this context.  This can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully.  The bug.lua file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.lua provides a corrected version.  The solution explicitly checks for 'nil' values and returns an appropriate error message or handles them appropriately to prevent unexpected calculations.
